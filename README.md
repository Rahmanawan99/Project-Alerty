In Pakistan and worldwide, construction sites are extremely dangerous, and no proper systems exist to ensure the safety of workers and minimization of the incidents. Moreover, the manual checking of each and every area of big construction sites is neither efficient nor beneficial.
AlertY will make use of OpenCV and image processing on CCTV footage and entrance cameras to highlight loopholes. This application is quite minimal and requires no constant monitoring or human attention, hence any issue flagged is alerted to the Project supervisor automatically.
We will train our model with various footages such as:
Loose Harness
Fire Sparks near flammable substances
Elevator Safety
Not wearing safety gear
And will then apply our model to live video. In case of any flagged content an alert will be generated and sent to the shift manager(or any other personnel) and a log will be generated of the event time, location and the sector where the potential incident had occurred.
